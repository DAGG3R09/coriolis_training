Global citizens are celebrating World Environment Day today, which was founded by the United Nation for encouraging worldwide awareness and action for the protection of our environment. The World Environment Day, which is commemorated every year on 5th June, revolves around spreading awareness about the environmental challenges the world is facing and measures to ensure saving the environment from further damage. Each year the World Environment Day is focused around a theme that draws attention on a particular environmental concern. This year the theme is on beating plastic pollution.
Plastic has long been a threat to environment, human health and animal lives. BPA is a chemical used to make plastic products. Heating foods in these products increases the amount of BPA that gets into our food, resulting in many health issues. When thrown out, plastic can ruin the soil quality, further hampering the environment. Basically, plastic can wreak havoc in our lives. We all use plastic in one way or the other; but most commonly we use it in our kitchens. From plastic bags to plastic water bottles and plastic tiffin boxes, we are harming our health and the environment.
